Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/solution/
 TRY THIS PROBLEM AGAIN IT LEADS TO MANY INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS
 - Used to find duplicates in an array where there is only 1 duplicate in the array
 - similar to check if there is a loop in a linked list

Moores Algorithm
To find the element that occurs more than n/2 times
- https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/solution/

Remove duplicates in an unsorted array
 - Make use of a hashtable O(n) time + O(n) space 
 - But if noe extra space is allowed use O(n**2) time + O(1) space
