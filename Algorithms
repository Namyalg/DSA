 TRY THIS PROBLEM AGAIN IT LEADS TO MANY INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS

 This is the thing, in the normal thing, u will be able to detect whether there is aloop and get out of it
 Here when u are asked the position at which the cycle starts, u start slow from head and wait for it to meet fast
 This is done after u find the existence of a cycle in a linked llllists
 - Used to find duplicates in an array where there is only 1 duplicate in the array
 - similar to check if there is a loop in a linked list

Moores Algorithm
To find the element that occurs more than n/2 times
- https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/solution/

Remove duplicates in an unsorted array
 - Make use of a hashtable O(n) time + O(n) space 
 - But if noe extra space is allowed use O(n**2) time + O(1) space
 
 For some palindrome questions, u can check by storing half of the elements in a stack and then popping those for the remaining elements

BFS AND DFS
breadth first search basically means u are going level wise visit all the nodes then move to the next level
depth first search u are reaching the bottom for one node at a time and then moving forward

 Extend vs append in python
 extend adds to the same object, while append will conisder a diffferent entity
 
 eg " a = [1,2,3,4], b = [5,6,7]
 a.append(b) = [1,2,3,4,[5,6,7]]
 a.extend(b) = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
