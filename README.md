### Kadanes algorithm ###

- Used for max subarray
- Complexity is O(n)

Very easy recursion question................................

## Consecutive letters ##
All can be done in O(n) complexity but the brute force approach will be O(n**3)

Most of the questions that need you to find the miniumum or maximum subseq or strings in an array can be done in time O(n) rather than O(n**3)


Binary search, recursive algo and iterative, both have time complexity of the order O(log(n)) but for recursive the space is o(logn) but iterative is o(1)

### bisect in python for binary search,  in_sort to insert an element to the correct position in a sorted array ###
bisect_right will get the position of insertion of an element into a sorted array from the right
bisect_left will get the position of insertion of an element into a sorted array from the left

### Longest I subsequence ###
https://cp-algorithms.com/sequences/longest_increasing_subsequence.html 

### Catalan numbers ###

These numbers can be used to represent the seq 1,1,2,5,42.......

given as (2n)!/(n+1)!n! where n is the nth term



### Sieve of eratosthenes ###
Primes between a range in O(sqrt(n)*log(log(n)) and space is O(n)


##Use the remove function to remove elements from a list in python ##
### Max product subsequence ##

On the lines of Kadane, keep track of the maximum and minimum product


### This can be used to do the longest increasing subsequence using bisect in python ##
