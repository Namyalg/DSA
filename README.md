Very easy recursion question................................

## Consecutive letters ##
All can be done in O(n) complexity but the brute force approach will be O(n**3)

Most of the questions that need you to find the miniumum or maximum subseq or strings in an array can be done in time O(n) rather than O(n**3)


Binary search, recursive algo and iterative, both have time complexity of the order O(log(n)) but for recursive the space is o(logn) but iterative is o(1)
