Very easy recursion question................................

## Consecutive letters ##
All can be done in O(n) complexity but the brute force approach will be O(n**3)

Most of the questions that need you to find the miniumum or maximum subseq or strings in an array can be done in time O(n) rather than O(n**3)


Binary search, recursive algo and iterative, both have time complexity of the order O(log(n)) but for recursive the space is o(logn) but iterative is o(1)

### bisect in python for binary search,  in_sort to insert an element to the correct position in a sorted array ###
bisect_right will get the position of insertion of an element into a sorted array from the right
bisect_left will get the position of insertion of an element into a sorted array from the left
