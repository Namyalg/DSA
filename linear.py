#Linear search takes O(n) as it needs to lookup every element in the array and if not found worst case would be O(n)
#The find function in C++, does the same and has the same complexity

#these apply to arrays only as other data structures have other better implementations

#So here is binary search that occurs in O(logn) base 2 as every iteration reduces the size by 2
