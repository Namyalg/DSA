### HEAPS
- WHY BUILD MAX HEAP HAS A COMPLEXITY OF O(n) ONLY, NOT O(nlogn) -------------------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ_Beap6Vo0
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k72DtCnY4MU    build heap has a complexity of O(n) and extract or to get the elements in order takes O(logn) so 
 it is O(nlogn)

### Misc
- Difference between emplace and push
  - For primitive data types the emplace and pushback functions work in the same way, however for objects and heavier data types use EMPLACE
  - When using classes and objects, for emplace and object is created in place, i.e it is not copied
  - While for push_back, an object is created and then copied to the vector , there is an overhead of copying
