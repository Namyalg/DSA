### Misc
- Difference between emplace and push
  - For primitive data types the emplace and pushback functions work in the same way, however for objects and heavier data types use EMPLACE
  - When using classes and objects, for emplace and object is created in place, i.e it is not copied
  - While for push_back, an object is created and then copied to the vector , there is an overhead of copying
